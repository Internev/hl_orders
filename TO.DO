- make sock component properly.
- Check DB for orderform on dashboard load. (need route etc) DONE
- Have totals on sock component, and overall one on orderform. Can all be part of the orderform reducer I think.
- import customer csv
- default customer to 'fresh: true', can be reset to this so signup page allows new password.
- change signup page to be 'register password' or something.
- get geolocation?
- squarespace: overlay text on image. (done-ish)
